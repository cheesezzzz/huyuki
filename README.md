Hey everyone!

This is my first ever coding project made with basic html and basic CSS. 

The landing page is where I experimented with creating a navigation bar, hovering effects, adding background images, centering texts (ehem... "divs"), etc.

The central theme of this landing page is my partner and I's travelling blog.
